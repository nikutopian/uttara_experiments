----------File: Input/Reports/Taxi to airport Sep 30 - to be reimbursed.pdf----------
Audit Decision: Does not Conform
Reason: Expense Document does not conform to the Expense Policy because it appears to be a taxi receipt, but there is no clear documentation of the business purpose or justification for the trip. The policy requires detailed receipts and the names of attendees for business meals, which are not provided in this case. Additionally, the expense amount (S$23.35) does not seem to be supported by any explanation or justification, which may lead to questions about its legitimacy under the policy's reasonableness principle.

Audit Decision: Does not Conform
Reason: The expense document does not conform with the expense policy.

Reason: The document lacks itemized receipts, detailed explanations of expenses, and names of individuals involved (if applicable), which are required by the policy for all expenses. Additionally, the policy requires prior approval for certain expenses, such as car rentals and luxury hotels, but these approvals are not indicated in the document.

----------File: Input/Reports/Taxi 28 Sep - MBS - to be reimbursed.pdf----------
Audit Decision: Does not Conform
Reason: The expense document provided does not conform to the company's expense policy.

Reason: The expense document appears to be a receipt from Gojek, a ride-hailing service, for a personal trip taken by an employee. The expense policy specifically states that ground transportation expenses should be reasonable and within the mid-range category, and that car rentals should be pre-approved and booked through preferred vendors. This expense does not meet these requirements as it is a personal trip and was not booked through a preferred vendor or approved in advance.

----------File: Input/Reports/Public transport 30 Sep.PNG----------
Audit Decision: Does not Conform
Reason: The primary reason this expense document does not conform to the company's expense policy is the lack of a detailed receipt or invoice for the MRT/BUS expenses (q BUS/MRT 186579481 and q BUS/MRT 186231877). The policy requires all expenses to be supported by appropriate documentation, such as receipts and invoices.
